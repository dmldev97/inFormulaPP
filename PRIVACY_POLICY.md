## inFormula app: Privacy Policy.

I have not programmed this app to collect personally identifiable information. Some data (such as leaderboards, race calendar) is stored only on your device and can be deleted by simply deleting the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerabilities that were inadvertently caused by me, or if you have any questions about how the app protects your privacy, please email me and I will certainly try to fix the problem/help you.
